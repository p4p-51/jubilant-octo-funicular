      Now youâ€™ve learnt how to introduce yourself, lets go into adding and categorizing previous experiences.
      Experiences can range from your previous team at work or university group projects.
      <br>
      <br>
      We'll use the experiences later down the line to prompt you when answering different interview questions. Be sure to
      add labels to your questions, as this will help you organise them later.
